Metals Risk Premia - Project Hub
==================================
Standalone landing dashboard: project overview, methodology, headline
findings, and conclusion, with buttons linking OUT to each asset-class
dashboard, each of which is its own SEPARATE Streamlit app deployment
(own URL, own compute/memory allocation, own git folder) rather than a
page within this one.

Why separate deployments instead of one multi-page app: each Streamlit
Community Cloud app gets its own container/resource allocation, so
splitting Metals / Energy / Precious Metals / NGL into distinct
deployments means one heavy or crashing dashboard can't starve the
others, and two people can work on two different asset-class folders
independently without touching this hub or each other's deployment.

This file depends only on common_shared.py (repo root) -- no dependency
on any other dashboard folder in this repo.

    """
A systematic framework that decomposes commodity futures returns into three economically distinct,
near-uncorrelated risk premia — **Momentum** (trend persistence), **Carry** (curve shape / roll yield),
and **Value** (mean-reversion to a long-run anchor) — then combines them into an equal-weight portfolio.
The central result on the metals pilot (Copper, Aluminium): three orthogonal sleeves of similar
stand-alone Sharpe combine into a portfolio whose risk-adjusted return materially exceeds any single
sleeve, while roughly halving drawdown.

Stage 1 (complete) validated the framework on LME Copper and Aluminium. Stage 2 (in progress) extends
the same three strategies — kept deliberately simple for now (no CTA-paper trend, no structural
Anchors, no walk-forward OOS yet) — to Oil & Energy, Precious Metals, and refined NGL products.

st.markdown(
    """
The diversification thesis holds on every metal tested so far: combining three economically distinct
premia consistently beats any single sleeve on a risk-adjusted basis, with materially lower drawdown.
Optimal parameters are asset-specific, not a one-size template — each new product gets its own
momentum speed, carry variant, and value anchor selected on its own data, same methodology throughout.
Stage 2 extends this test to a genuinely different asset class (energy, refined products) to see
whether the same three-premia structure holds outside metals.
